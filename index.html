			I'm an Imagineer, working for Disney as a Software Developer in Los Angeles.  I'm helping to create the next generation of theme parks, which started with the new Star Wars additions. I'm currently working on Avenger's Headquarters in Disneyland.  To accomplish this, I'm working with fellow Imagineers from many different disciplines.  I help to provide tools and pipelines for these folks to do their jobs as effectively as possible, and every once in awhile, I'll contribute code that goes directly into attractions.  I mainly work in C++ and Python, with a focus in game engines such as UE4.  Here are some projects, past and present.

			During the entirety of this project I was on the team responsible for the core engine technology and tools.  While working on this project we developed internal tools that allowed for distribution, automated testing, and quality assurance for the attraction, as well as future attractions.  One feature I was critical in creating included a full automated testing system that included a UE4 test plugin, automated scripts that ran the tests themselves, and a pieces of a web application that was used to view the results of the tests in a way that could be easily digested.  I also developed a small tool that could be used by artists to view their work in a format closer to what the attraction would actually look like, remotely.  There was also some light debugging work, mainly involving UE4 and C++.  It's very difficult to fully ecompass the work that I did on this project, so try dropping me a line about it if you'd like to know more about my role!

			I had a small role in the beginning of this project.  ILMxLab was experimenting with motion tracking within the Unreal 4 game engine, and I implemented a small system that I gave them and advised them on during the prototypical stages of the project.  While this wasn't the shipped tracking solution, this UE4 plugin allowed them to get working quickly on fleshing out their creative concepts.

			I worked hand-in-hand with the ILM Stage Crew in order to design and create a space that could be used jointly as a virtual production stage between ILM and WDI.  I was ultimately resposible for speccing, designing, and installing all of the projection in the space.  I also assisted ILMxLab with calibration data ingestion, as well as integrating, calibrating, and testing the WDI side of the system.

			Mekazoo is what I devoted the majority of my time to in 2014.  I worked on this title with 14 (and growing) other developers at a startup indie game studio called Good Mood Creators.  I was one of three programmers on the team and I was responsible for the camera system, tools for designers and artists ( in Unity and Maya ), as well as performance, debugging, character controllers, game logic, AI, and a host of other developer tasks ranging from web dev to design.
