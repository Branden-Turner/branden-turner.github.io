			I'm an Imagineer, working for Disney as a Software Developer in Los Angeles.  I'm helping to create the next generation of theme parks, which started with the new Star Wars additions. I'm currently working on Avenger's Headquarters in Disneyland.  To accomplish this, I'm working with fellow Imagineers from many different disciplines.  I help to provide tools and pipelines for these folks to do their jobs as effectively as possible, and every once in awhile, I'll contribute code that goes directly into attractions.  I mainly work in C++ and Python, with a focus in game engines such as UE4.  Here are some projects, past and present:

			<p style="font-size: 14px">
			I can't talk much about this particular role just yet since the project is still in motion, but I mainly work as an integrator and software developer!  So far I've helped integrate various software pieces of the project, along with integrating portions of the ride with an automated testing system for monitoring performance data.

			I was on the team responsible for the core engine technology and tools for the entirety of the project's duration. While working on this project, my team developed internal tools that allowed for distribution, automated testing, and quality assurance for the attraction, as well as future attractions. One feature I was critical in creating included a fully automated testing system that encompassed everything from running the engine automatically, to a front-end for viewing the results in a way that was digestible for different disciplines. I also developed a tool that could be used by artists to view their work in a format closer to what the attraction would actually look like, remotely. There was also some light debugging work, mainly involving UE4 and C++. It's very difficult to fully encompass the work that I did on this project, so try dropping me a line about it if you'd like to know more about my role!

			I had a small role in the beginning of this project.  ILMxLab was experimenting with motion tracking within the Unreal 4 game engine, and I implemented a small system that I gave them and advised them on during the prototypical stages of the project.  While this was a temporary tracking solution, the plugin allowed them to get started quickly fleshing out their ideas.

			I worked hand-in-hand with the ILM Stage Crew in order to create a space that could be used jointly as a virtual stage between ILM and WDI.  I was ultimately responsible for speccing, designing, and installing all of the projection in the space.  I also assisted ILMxLab with calibration data ingestion, as well as integrating, calibrating, and testing the WDI side of the system.

			<p style="font-size: 14px">
			Mekazoo is what I devoted the majority of my time to in 2014.  I worked on this title with 14 (and growing) other developers at a startup indie game studio called Good Mood Creators.  I was one of three programmers on the team and I was responsible for the camera system, tools for designers and artists ( in Unity and Maya ), as well as performance, debugging, character controllers, game logic, AI, and a host of other developer tasks ranging from web dev to design.
